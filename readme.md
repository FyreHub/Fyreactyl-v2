Mono repository with NestJS and React with business logic and separated components library.

So, the repository has 4 parts:

- `client` A React application.
- `common` Logic shared between client and server.
- `NestJS` The NestJS application.

## How to start it

To start the project, run `yarn dev`

Note: I am not sure if NPM works well with this setup so make sure to use yarn as me :D
